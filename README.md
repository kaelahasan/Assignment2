# Final Grade Calculator 

## Functionality 
Final Grade Calculator
 * I created my own grading schemes
 * Calculating grades for three different classes
 * Math 182 and Pic 10C have two schemes, Math 168 only has one
 * The sliders are connected to the spin boxes, so their values update one another
 * After any change in value to the spinbox (which includes changes to the sliders), the private variables are updated and the final grade functions are called
 * This means, after any changes to the GUI, the grades update
